# Admission Prediction App using FastAPI
This is a Python Web Application that serves as an example of integrating
ML models to FastAPI to allow other applications to interact with the ML model
via an API endpoint. The FastAPI provides the API functionality and the ngrok
services allow us to deploy to the web for global access.

### Technologies Used:
- FastAPI - Used this for building API that interacts with the model and gives us the prediction
- Unicorn - Used as an ASGI Web Server for Hosting the FastAPI Application
- Ngrok - Used to expose the local endpoint to the globally hosted endpoint. 
- Pydantic - Used as a Data Validation Library for FastAPI POST requests.
- Scikit-Learn - Used for loading the trained model into memory and predicting the result
- Pandas, Numpy - Shape the inputs in the desired format for the Predictive model.

## Pre-requisites to run the Project
To run this project, you need a few things:
- Installed Python 3.9+
- Python IDE of your choice (Pycharm in my case)

## How to run the Project
#### Clone this project
Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local system.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/syedsadiquh/Admission-Prediction-FastAPI.git
```

#### Create a Virtual Python Environment
However, a virtual Python environment (venv) is not necessary to run this project. 
It is recommended to use a virtual environment as ngrok and other packages are 
specific to this project and may clash with other versions.
<br>To create a new python venv. First, open the cloned repo in your favourite IDE
and open the terminal. Run this command while being in the project's directory.
```shell
python -m venv venv
```
Now, that the venv is created with the name 'venv'. Activate it using a specific command for your OS:
<br>MacOS `source activate venv/bin/activate`
<br>Windows (in CMD) `env/Scripts/activate.bat`
<br>Windows (in powershell) `env/Scripts/Activate.ps1`

#### Install dependencies
Install the required packages for this project.
Run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Setting up Ngrok account
Signup/Login for Ngrok account (free or paid). 
Get your AuthToken from ngrok.

#### Setting up the Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
Paste the AuthToken obtained from ngrok as 'NGROK_AUTHTOKEN'
```env
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx
```
NOTE: Replace "xxxxxxx...." with your AuthToken.

#### Setting up the Domain
If you don't have a static domain, Please omit the domain parameter in forward()<br>
i.e. use as `listener = ngrok.forward(addr=APPLICATION_PORT, authtoken_from_env = True)`<br>
Ngrok will provide a random URL for your project that can be viewed on your Ngrok dashboard.

If you have a static domain, replace the provided domain with your static domain.

#### Run the Project
The final Project Structure should look like this:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ student.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ml_model
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admission_prediction_model.h5
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useModel.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ test_main.http
â””â”€â”€ venv
    â”œâ”€â”€ bin ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib ...
    â””â”€â”€ pyvenv.cfg
```
NOTE: The `main.py` has been inside an app directory with empty `__init__.py` for Docker support. 
It is not mandatory to follow this structure. Changes to the commands are to be made accordingly.

To Run the Project:
```shell
./venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The project's Swagger Docs can be viewed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## How to use the Project
This Project can be used as an example of using FastAPI to utilize the 
trained models for prediction. It utilizes ngrok to provide a global 
endpoint that can be integrated into different applications and use the 
trained model as per their requirement.
